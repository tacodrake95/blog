A collection of books, blog posts, essays, and other works that I recommend for everyone, but especially those in tech.

### Books
- [An Introduction to Information Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Information-Theory-Symbols-Mathematics/dp/0486240614)
- [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/releases)

### Essays
What distinguishes a long-form blog post from an essay? For me, structure, tone, and intentionality. But don't get too hung up on it.

- [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)

### Blogs and such
- [The Engineer/Management Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/)
- [Engineering Management: The Pendulum or the Ladder](https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/)
- [How Apple and Amazon Security Flaws Led to My Epic Hacking](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/)
  - An excellent profile of a real-world social engineering attack
