# "It's Tradition"

​	Since the dawn of human society, the models used to keep them stable have all had a tipping point of instability. The justification to keep modeling societies that way has been "the instability point is so far out that we won't reach it."

​	Then as societies began to get close to that point, even when it was clear that they would eventually go beyond it, the justification became "we have always done it this way, why would we do it any other way."

​	This is *not* good enough. Tradition is not a good enough reason to continue self destructive practices. And worse, our population is at a point where in order to reach a critical mass of people who are willing to change, you would need one of several options which I will lay out below **NONE OF WHICH ARE GOOD OPTIONS**!

- Population control

  - Would require critical mass to agree in order to be effective without coercion or force
  - If not, would require one or more of the following
    - A more destructive world war
    - Massive famine
    - Government enforced birth limits (see China's history to find out how that affects male to female ratio)
    - Government enforced death lotteries
    - Government enforced eugenics

- Effective mass propaganda advocating for such changes

  - Would require all major countries to fully control their media

    or

  - Media must be fully compliant

- Unilateral adoption of changes required 

  - Breaks human rights and constitutional laws
  - Breaks international laws
  - Removes will of the masses entirely



​	Now, how did we get to this point? Funny you should ask. I was getting there next. This point has been reached as a direct result of the wealthy manipulating society to make them toys which has the byproduct of useful technologies, techniques, and processes filtering down for use in more practical applications.

​	This would be all well and good if those who are actually making these things were payed enough to be able to afford the enjoyment of some portion of them. Unfortunately this is not usually the case.

​	Those who physically do the work are kept from enjoying the fruits of their labors without being pigeonholed into debt which will pass to their children and continue to accumulate. That debt is not to another person who will eventually die, but to a corporate entity which will be around until it is dissolved or has gone bankrupt. 

​	At which point the people who are in charge of said entity when it does so (who may or may not be the original instantiators) can sell that debt off to some other corporate entity to keep the blue collar cash juicer flowing. This merely accumulates a debt burden on successive generations which cripples entire lineages.

​	"But, this doesn't explain the population boom..." you may be thinking to yourself. Yes, at a surface level, this is just a description of the way people treat each other. But if you look at emergent phenomena and not merely the fundamental operations of the system itself. The need the wealthy seem to have for toys and showpieces requires a huge manual labor population to sustain. Without this, there would be less competition for completion of the same task and the price would be too much even for the wealthy to afford. So they did what they do and worked society to their whims to create it. 

​	As someone who sees through the charade of "you must work for the system because the system works for you," yet being capable of performing the tasks asked of me, I choose not to because I refuse to be a cog in a global Rube Goldberg machine aimed at humanity. I am often ridiculed for not simply finding employment somewhere that I have areas of interest and a technical understanding. "That's the way the world works" they will tell me.

​	Which is funny, because that's the same justification people are always using to keep perpetrating crimes against humanity such as female genital mutilation. "It's tradition, this is how we do it."
